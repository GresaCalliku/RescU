# RescU
Assessing Rescue Factors in Densely Built Urban Areas

### Project Overview

This project explores the emergency rescue capabilities in densely populated urban environments through case studies in **Mong Kok (Hong Kong)** and **Dhaka (Bangladesh)**. These areas are known for their complex layouts, narrow streets, and high building density. 

The goal is to develop a **"rescue factor"**â€”a composite metric derived from geospatial analysis, image processing, and simulationâ€”that quantifies the accessibility of different streets for emergency response. The resulting insights can support urban planning and emergency preparedness.
